The problem was resolved by carefully examining the HTML structure and identifying a nested element with conflicting inline styles. Removing these inline styles resolved the issue.  Additionally, adding a more specific class selector to the problematic element ensured that the Tailwind styles applied correctly.  This highlights the need for attention to detail when working with CSS and nested elements.  Ensure that conflicting styles are identified and addressed appropriately to maintain the integrity of your layout.
