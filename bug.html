I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  My HTML structure was seemingly correct, and my CSS file was correctly imported.  The issue only occurred on specific elements and not across the entire project.  Debugging showed that the classes were present in the HTML but not being rendered visually.
