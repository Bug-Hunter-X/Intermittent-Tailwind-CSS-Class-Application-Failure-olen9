This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are intermittently not applied to specific elements. The bug is present in `bug.html` and a solution is provided in `bugSolution.html`. The issue is not related to general Tailwind configuration, but appears to be related to specific element interactions or potentially conflicting CSS rules. The solution involves carefully reviewing the HTML structure for conflicts, ensuring proper class application, and potentially adding more specific class selectors to override potential style collisions.
